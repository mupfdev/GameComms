# GameComms

GameComms is a connectivity library specialised for multidevice games
programming on the Series 60 platform to connect up to four devices via
Bluetooth. GameComms was part of the proprietary Nokia N-Gage SDK and
was used in 42 of a total of 55 games.

This project is an attempt to create drop-in replacements of the 9
different versions that were included in the official games.

The primary idea is to send the data handled by GameComms serially to a
WiFi-enabled microcontroller or a modern PC, for example, in order to
connect several devices via the Internet.
